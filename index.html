		<h2>Homework part one: Creative dataviz critique</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following creative dataviz stories, and carefully consume it, both text and creative elements. Make sure you spend time fully with each element. Then, critique it. Below the instructions, you should write the name of the project inside an h3 tag, and write at least three paragraphs and insert them below inside three separate p tags. Don't forget to close your tags!</p>
		<h3>Women's Pockets</h3>
		<p>The article I read was the one about women’s pockets being too small compared to men’s pockets. I found this article really interesting, as I think it highlighted a lot of disparities between women and men’s issues. What it normally boils down to, is not apparent sexism or discrimination, but rather the idea that women are just inherently less in need of things then men. The idea that men are these people that need the most effective tools and women would rather be fashionable is just bs.<p>
		<p>It’s also the idea that the fashion industry has a grip on what people can and cannot do. While it would make sense for men and women to both have deep pockets, the fashion industry would be sure to oppose it as purses and other fashionable holding devices make too much money to give women the ability to hold things on their own.<p>
		<p>In terms of visual elements, the sliding pocket screen is really cool. It shows the average size of women’s pockets vs. men’s pockets, and I think it’s very effective in showing how much smaller women's pockets are than mens. The second one is good too, but my issue with it is, if you’re gonna show how something doesn’t fit in a pocket, it needs to look like it’s not going to fit in the graphic.<p>

		<p>Answer <i>at least</i> the following questions, and be thorough and detailed in your responses: Where is the data from in this project, and what dataviz/graphics/visual elements are used? What do you think is the key message of this dataviz project? Describe the different ways in which this dataviz project is effective at conveying its key message. Mona Chalabi talks about her dataviz projects being visceral, or having to do with deep, internal feelings rather than the intellect, in order to be memorable -- in what ways do you feel this dataviz project was visceral?</p>

		<h3>Women's Pockets</h3>
		<p>In reality, the women's pocket visuals were mayble not visceral, but they do catch the attention of the reader. In an article that specializes on a medium where you have to see it in order to really soak it in, it uses that to it's advantage, drawing your eyes in. It's not a graph or chart, but rather a couple pictures of pockets overlayed over things in order for the viewer to see the real difference in pocket sizes.<p>



		<h2>Homework part two: Datawrapper chart</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following datasets -- one of which we've used in the past -- to create one, fully complete Datawrapper chart or map, that reflects at least one finding from this dataset. Insert it below the instructions inside an iframe tag.</p>
		<p>Attributes of a fully complete Datawrapper chart: Hed, subhed, data source, alt text, legend, byline, any notes about data limitations or details, any annotations that you feel help convey your finding(s). Remember: your finding should be reflected in either your hed or subhed, and an explanation of your data (where it's from, what it collects, etc.) should be reflected in the other. You must choose colors from a color palette generator; you may not use Datawrapper's default colors.</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these datasets:</h3>

		</ul>

  		<p>When you're done with both parts of this homework, return to Blackboard assignment step #4, and follow the instructions to get this on your Github page.</p>
