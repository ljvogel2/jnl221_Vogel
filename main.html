<h1>Ex-CEO from Chicago Arrested After Attending the January 6th Insurrection</h1>
<h2>Bradley Rukstales apologized and said he regrets his actions, which prosecutors said included throwing a chair in the direction of Capitol police.</h2>
<p><strong>By Dennis Romero</strong></p>
<p>A Chicago-area man who lost his job as CEO of a tech firm because he participated in the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-defends-jan-6-rioters-hang-mike-pence-chant-newly-n1283798">Jan. 6 post-election unrest at the U.S. Capitol</a> was sentenced Friday.<br><br>
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/illinois-ceo-arrested-during-capitol-riots-says-he-was-wrong-n1253502">Bradley Rukstales</a> of Inverness, Illinois, was sentenced to 30 days in prison and ordered by U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols to pay $500 in restitution to the Department of the Treasury.<br><br>
The punishment was guided by a plea agreement. Rukstales pleaded guilty Aug. 31 to one misdemeanor count of demonstrating inside the Capitol.<br><br>
The deal meant that three other counts, related to allegations Rukstales trespassed and committed crimes on federal property, were dropped, according to a federal sentencing memo filed Nov. 4.<br><br></p>

<p>In the sentencing memo, prosecutors presented still photos of security video that show a man in a red hat they identified as Rukstales following retreating officers and confronting them after tossing a chair. Officers then dragged Rukstales behind a police line and arrested him.<br><br>

“Rukstales remained in the thick of that chaos and did not leave,” prosecutors said in the memo.<br><br>

The next day, Capitol police <a href="https://www.uscp.gov/media-center/press-releases/us-capitol-police-arrests-january-6-2021">announced 14 people, including the CEO</a>, had been arrested in the unrest. Rukstales was one 10 people initially charged with unlawful entry.<br><br>

Rukstales told <a href="https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2021/01/08/brad-rukstales-of-inverness-arrested-at-u-s-capitol-riot-apologizes-and-expresses-embarrassment/">CBS2 Chicago</a> on Jan. 7 that the rally outside the Capitol the morning before — during which <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/let-us-what-happened-after-trump-told-his-supporters-storm-n1253168">Trump encouraged supporters to “fight harder”</a> — was “great.” But as the chaos unfolded, Rukstales said he found himself amid violence he later condemned.<br><br>
